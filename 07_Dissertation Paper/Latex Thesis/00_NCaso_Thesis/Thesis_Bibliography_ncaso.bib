  abstract = {Optoacoustic (OA, photoacoustic) imaging capitalizes on the low scattering of ultrasound within biological tissues to provide optical absorption-based contrast with high resolution at depths not reachable with optical microscopy. For deep tissue imaging applications, OA image formation commonly relies on acoustic inversion of time-resolved tomographic data. The excitation of OA responses and subsequent propagation of ultrasound waves can be mathematically described as a forward model enabling image reconstruction               via               algebraic inversion. These model-based reconstruction methods have been shown to outperform alternative inversion approaches and can further render OA images from incomplete datasets, strongly distorted signals or other suboptimally recorded data. Herein, we provide a general perspective on model-based OA reconstruction methods, review recent progress, and discuss the performance of the different algorithms under practical imaging scenarios.},

  abstract = {Delay-and-sum (DAS) is the most widespread digital beamformer in high-frame-rate ultrasound imaging. Its implementation is simple and compatible with real-time applications. In this viewpoint article, we describe the fundamentals of DAS beamforming. The underlying theory and numerical approach are detailed so that users can be aware of its functioning and limitations. In particular, we discuss the importance of the f-number and speed of sound on image quality, and propose one solution to set their values from a physical viewpoint. We suggest determining the f-number from the directivity of the transducer elements and the speed of sound from the phase dispersion of the delayed signals. Simplified Matlab codes are provided for the sake of clarity and openness. The effect of the f-number and speed of sound on the lateral resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio was investigated in vitro and in vivo. If not properly preset, these two factors had a substantial negative impact on standard metrics of image quality (namely CNR and FWHM). When beamforming with DAS in vitro or in vivo, it is recommended to optimize these parameters in order to use it wisely and prevent image degradation.},

  abstract = {Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a hybrid imaging modality that acoustically detects the optical absorption contrast, is a promising technology for imaging hemodynamic functions in deep tissues far beyond the traditional optical microscopy. However, the most clinically compatible PAT often suffers from the poor image fidelity, mostly due to the limited detection view of the linear ultrasound transducer array. PAT can be improved by employing highly-absorbing contrast agents such as droplets and nanoparticles, which, however, have low clinical translation potential due to safety concerns and regulatory hurdles imposed by these agents. In this work, we have developed a new methodology that can fundamentally improve PAT's image fidelity without hampering any of its functional capability or clinical translation potential. By using clinically-approved microbubbles as virtual point sources that strongly and isotropically scatter the local pressure waves generated by surrounding hemoglobin, we can overcome the limited-detection-view problem and achieve high-fidelity functional PAT in deep tissues, a technology referred to as virtual-point-source PAT (VPS-PAT). We have thoroughly investigated the working principle of VPS-PAT by numerical simulations and in vitro phantom experiments, clearly showing the signal origin of VPSs and the resultant superior image fidelity over traditional PAT. We have also demonstrated in vivo applications of VPT-PAT for functional small-animal studies with physiological challenges. We expect that VPS-PAT can find broad applications in biomedical research and accelerated translation to clinical impact.},
