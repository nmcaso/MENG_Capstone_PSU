% Abstract:
The fields of both Photoacoustics and Ultrasound use several methods of imaging algorithms to beamform timeseries data from a device's transducers into an image. The simplest of these methods is Delay-and-Sum (DAS), wherein the algorithm applies a delay proportional to the distance from an imaging plane to a plane of potential point sources. If done for every sensor using a 2-Dimensional plane of point sources and subsequently averaged across sensors, the result is an image of the sources in the plane.

Modern Photoacoustic problems require fast imaging techniques for example when examining tissue real-time, for example to see the relative levels of blood oxygenation spreading through a set of blood vessels. The computational routines must keep pace. This project introduces a MATLAB-compatible toolbox of fast delay-and-sum algotithms parallelized for GPU computation. These algorithms include delay and sum by indexing with a delay matrix, sparse matrix multiplication, and the corresponding GPU Parralelized versions of each. We found the matrix multiplication on the GPU on MATLAB to be the fastest, followed closely by a CUDA Compiled function that runs delay-matrix indexing.
