The fields of both Photoacoustics and Ultrasound use several methods of imaging algorithms to beamform timeseries data from a device's transducers into an image. The simplest of these methods is Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming, wherein the algorithm applies a delay proportional to the distance from a transducer imaging plane to a plane of virtual locations. If performed for many sensors in an array using a 2-Dimensional plane of point sources and subsequently averaging across sensors, the result is an image of the sources.

To enable real-time imaging and examinations of modern photoacoustic problems, such as the assessment of relative levels of oxygenation in blood vessels within an organ, fast imaging techniques are essential. Therefore, computational routines must keep pace with these demands. This project introduces a MATLAB-compatible toolbox of fast delay-and-sum algorithms parallelized for GPU computation. This includes delay and sum by indexing with a delay matrix, sparse matrix multiplication, and the corresponding GPU parallelized versions of each. The results indicate matrix multiplication on the GPU in MATLAB is the fastest, followed closely by a CUDA Compiled function that runs delay-matrix indexing. Finally, this paper introduces a novel delay-matrix rotation algorithm with high pixel-bandwidth and therefore utility to high-resolution imaging.
