The fields of both Photoacoustics and Ultrasound use several methods of imaging algorithms to beamform timeseries data from a device's transducers into an image. The simplest of these methods is Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming, wherein the algorithm applies a delay proportional to the distance from a transducer imaging plane to a plane of virtual locations. If performed for many sensors in an array using a 2-Dimensional plane of point sources and subsequently averaging across sensors, the result is an image of the sources.

Modern Photoacoustics problems require fast imaging techniques for real-time imaging and examinations, for example, to see relative levels of oxygenation spreading through blood vessels in an organ. Computational routines must keep pace. This project introduces a MATLAB-compatible toolbox of fast delay-and-sum algorithms parallelized for GPU computation. This includes delay and sum by indexing with a delay matrix, sparse matrix multiplication, and the corresponding GPU Parralelized versions of each. We found the matrix multiplication on the GPU on MATLAB to be the fastest, followed closely by a CUDA Compiled function that runs delay-matrix indexing. Finally, this paper introduces a novel delay-matrix rotation algorithm with high throughput and therefore utility to high-resolution imaging.
