Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Yun Jing for his guidance and mentorship throughout this project. It is thanks to him I am afforded this opportunity and further opportunities in my education in the future. I would also like to thank Paul Klippel for his assistance and providing me with the background to this project. The mental framework that both mentors taught me is invaluable, and I will carry it forward to give back to society. 

I would also like to thank our collaborators at Duke University including Junjie Yao and the rest of the Photoacoustic Imaging Lab for providing their data and initial code. 

Finally, I would like to thank my friends, my family, my National Guard unit, and my various other loved ones for their continuous support.
