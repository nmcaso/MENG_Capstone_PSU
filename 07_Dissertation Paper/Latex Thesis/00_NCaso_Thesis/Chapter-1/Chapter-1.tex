\section{Background of Photoacoustics}
\label{chapter1:backg_photoacoustics}

Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is an emergent modality of sonic body imaging wherein a tissue is irradiated with a laser pulsed at an ultrasonic frequency. Tissues in the body with a high absorption coefficient for the laser's wavelength absorb energy and increase in temperature and thermally expand, and contract, at the pulse rate. For a point scatterer in the tissue, this behavior induces a monopole-like acoustic sound source, which may be detected at the surface of the tissue by an ultrasound transceiver device.
