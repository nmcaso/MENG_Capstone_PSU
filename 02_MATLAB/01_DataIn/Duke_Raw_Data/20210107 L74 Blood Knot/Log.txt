P: startDepth and endDepth for data acquisition in terms of wavelength. For PA use, use P(2,:)
PARcvData: PA Aline lengths x channel number x frame number （80 ns system delay, corresponding to 16.7 data points, so the start point is around 17th data point）
temperature: water temperature measured during the experiment
Trans: transducer information
	frequency: central frequency (unit, MHz)
	sampling frequency: 4*central frequency, in this case 4*5.208
